# STM32F446RE Embedded Systems Project

🚀 A hands-on embedded project built on the STM32F446RE microcontroller, designed to showcase key features such as GPIO control, UART communication, and peripheral integration.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains embedded firmware developed for the STM32F446RE Nucleo board using STM32CubeIDE. The project demonstrates:

- GPIO pin control for LED toggling and status indication
- UART communication for real-time serial logging
- Integration with sensors via I2C/SPI (optional expansion)
- Basic system initialization using HAL drivers

## 📦 Features

- 🔴 Toggle LEDs connected to GPIO pins (e.g., PC13)
- 📡 Send and receive data over UART using Minicom
- 📈 Prepare for integration of temperature or air quality sensors
- ⚙️ STM32CubeMX-based configuration
- 📁 Modular file organization: main, peripherals, and utilities

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Install Tools:**
   - STM32CubeIDE
   - STM32CubeMX (optional)
   - Minicom or Tera Term for serial monitoring

2. **Connect Hardware:**
   - STM32F446RE Nucleo board via USB
   - Optional: sensors via I2C/SPI headers

3. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ps1523/ps1523-stm32-f446re-project.git
Import into STM32CubeIDE:

Open STM32CubeIDE

Go to File > Open Projects from File System and select the cloned folder

Build and Flash:

Click the build icon 🛠️

Use the debug button ▶️ to flash and run the code on your board

Monitor Output:

Open Minicom with appropriate serial port (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0)

View logs or sensor data in real-time

📚 Project Goals
Demonstrate core MCU features like GPIO and UART

Lay groundwork for IoT applications (e.g., environmental monitoring)

Practice modular and maintainable embedded development
